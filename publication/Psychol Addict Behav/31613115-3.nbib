TI  - The longitudinal effect of early-life sensation seeking on gambling and gambling 
      problems among Puerto Rican young adults.
PG  - 201-208

AB  - Sensation seeking has been proposed as a risk factor for gambling and gambling 
      problems; however, existing evidence for a relationship between sensation seeking 
      and gambling behaviors is inconclusive and data are lacking for emerging adults and 
      racial and ethnic minorities. In this longitudinal study, we explored the 
      association between developmental trajectories of sensation seeking in childhood and 
      adolescence and gambling and gambling problems in early adulthood in individuals of 
      Puerto Rican origin. Gambling data were collected during 2014-2018 from a subsample 
      of participants in the Boricua Youth Study who were recruited in the South Bronx of 
      New York City and in San Juan and Caguas, Puerto Rico. Sensation seeking was 
      measured using a 10-item instrument modified from the scale created by Russo et al. 
      for use in children as young as 5 years old. Developmental trajectories of 
      age-adjusted sensation seeking were created using growth mixture models. Gambling 
      and gambling problems were assessed based on the Canadian Adolescent Gambling 
      Inventory (CAGI) Version 1.09. Data were analyzed using descriptive methods and 
      multivariable logistic regression. Individuals in the high sensation-seeking class 
      had lower adjusted odds of past-year gambling (OR = .36; 95% confidence interval 
      [.14, .92]) than did those in the normative sensation-seeking class, whereas no 
      differences were observed for individuals in the low and accelerated classes. No 
      relationship was found between sensation seeking and past-year gambling problems. 
      Given the severe consequences of early initiation of gambling and gambling problems, 
      other early life risk factors and alternative hypotheses for the elevated prevalence 
      of gambling problems in young adults and racial and ethnic minority populations 
      should be explored. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved).
